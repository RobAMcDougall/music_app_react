      <h1>The Killers</h1>
      <p>{"Born under the electric lights of Las Vegas in 2001, The Killers have evolved from their indie dance-rock roots into global rock champions. Fronted by the charismatic Brandon Flowers and fueled by Dave Keuning’s searing guitar, Mark Stoermer’s rhythmic bass, and Ronnie Vannucci Jr.’s driving drums, they blend influences from 80s synth-pop to heartland rock, creating anthems that ignite stadiums and linger in hearts. With chart-topping albums like “Hot Fuss” and “Sam’s Town,” they’ve captivated audiences with their dynamic sound, vivid storytelling, and electrifying live shows, solidifying their place as one of the most successful and beloved bands of the 21st century. So put on your dancing shoes, raise your neon-tinged lighters, and get ready to experience the heart-pounding, soul-stirring phenomenon that is The Killers."}</p>
